/*
-- The Cpp pre-processor 
is a program that processes your source code before the compiler sees it. 
the cpp pre-processore first strips all the comments from the source code and replace with a single space
then it looks for pre-processor directives and executes them

-- Pre-processor directives are lines in the source code that begin with pound or hashtag symbol. 

-- When the pre-processor sees directive, it replaces the pound include line with the file that it's referring to
that it recursively processes that file as well   
Preprocessor directives have commonly used to conditionally compile code.
