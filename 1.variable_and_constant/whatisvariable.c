/*
--A basic architecture of a typical computer system that is memory, a CPU and a bus that allows the movement of data between the CPU and memory.

--RAM is a contiguous(lien ke) block of storage used by the computer instructions as well as data/ 
RAM can be thought of as having memory cells where each cell has an associated location.

--If we had to program using the specific memory locations, it wouldn't be a lot of fun, and we'd likely have a lot of programmer errors.
Imagine saying something like move 21 to memory location 1002 is kinda hart to remember. 

--However, mmost PL( Programming Language ) allow to associate a name with a memory location so we don't have to worry about 
the exact memory location of the variable is associated with. 

--to recap, a variable is an abstraction for a memory location.
